# TfkToast

**TfkToast** is a Flutter package designed to display beautiful and customizable toast notifications. Toast messages provide non-intrusive feedback to users, enhancing their experience.

## Features

- **Customizable Toasts**: Display toasts with various types (info, warning, error, success).
- **Customizable Title and Message**: Add a title and message to your toast notifications.
- **Automatic Dismissal**: Toasts automatically disappear after a few seconds.
- **Manual Dismissal**: Optionally, allow users to manually close the toast.
